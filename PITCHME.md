## What is PowerShell? 
* PowerShell is a command-line interface (CLI)... 
*  ... that contains a rich, yet simplified scripting language for automating complex, multi-step tasks
* Built on the .NET Framework
* Extensible, so various products and technologies can be managed by “snapping in” tech-specific extensions
* Most importantly... it’s **discoverable**! It can teach you how to use itself!
